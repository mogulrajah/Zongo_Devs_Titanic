This project explores the historic titanic dataset of the catastrophic 1912 Titanic event. With this project, we builds a logistic regression model to predicting the rate of Survival for passengers who took part in this tour event which was expected to be one of the world's luxurious and prestigious maiden voyage. The logistic regression was justified based of the nature of the dependent variable being binary. Hence prediction of Survivalbility was possible based on variables such as; Age,Gender,passenger class, among others.   
We started by first exploring the data, using an Exploratory Data Analysis. We did this to try to make more sense of our data, after reading it in a python environment. we selected python in view of its versatility, user friendliness, and general acceptability in terms of its accuracy of results.
